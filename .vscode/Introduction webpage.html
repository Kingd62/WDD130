    <p> Hi, I'm David Myers. I am from Blue Springs, Missouri. It's a nice city, about 15 minutes away from Kansas City. You might of heard about a Blizzard that swept Kansas City. There was about a foot of snow, which is crazy in Midwest. My family has lived there for almost 9 years now and it been a great place to live in.
    <p> I am 19 years old and I'm currently attending BYU-Idaho. My Major is Computer Information Technology. I am single and not ready to mingle. I like to read, Watch some anime, and Play good video games, of course.
    <p>I've been a member of the Chruch of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints for all my life and that was thanks to my Dad, who was just a young guy in the army that heard about the chruch. He actually wasn't that much older than me when he became a member. Sometimes, I do wish that i knew what it feels like to live life without the Gospel, just for some extra perspective.
