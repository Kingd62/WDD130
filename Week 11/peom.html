        <p>Beneath the sky, so vast and wide,
            A journey waits, where dreams abide.</p>
        <p>Through fields of gold and rivers clear,
            A path unknown, yet drawing near</p>
        <p>A quiet thought, a passing glance,
            The world spins on in endless dance.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="block2">
        <p> And though we wander far apart,
            The road we walk is in our heart
            </p>
        <p>Through moonlit nights, the stars do gleam,
            A steady guide for those who dream.</p>
        <p>The heavens open, paths unfold,
            A story written, brave and bold.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="block3">
        <p>With every step, a tale is told,
            Of fleeting dreams and hands to hold.
            </p>
        <p>The world turns softly, yet so fast,
            Each moment lost, but never past.</p>
        <p>So take my hand, and don’t look back,
        We’ll find the way through every crack.
        </p>

    <section class="block4">
        <p>For in our hearts, we are alive,
        Together strong, together we’ll thrive.
        </p>
        <p>The moonlit path begins to glow,
        And still, we wonder where we’ll go</p>
        <p>So fear not, friend, the road ahead,
        For you’re not lost,nor left for dead.</p>
        <p> The journey’s long, but worth the ride,
        We walk together, side by side.</p>
